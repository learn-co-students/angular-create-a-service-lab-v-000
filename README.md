# Create a Service structure

## Objectives

- Write a custom Service
- Use the custom Service in Controller

## Instructions

Let's write our own service to do some basic math.

Using the existing directory structure, we've got a controller that's trying to call a service that doesn't exist yet, named `MathService`. Create that service in `js/app/services/MathService.js`.

Our controller is trying to call `MathService.sum()` with an array of numbers, expecting it to return the sum of all those numbers. Create this method, then see if it displays the sum correctly!
